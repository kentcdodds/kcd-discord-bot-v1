    BOT: Hello <@mock-user> 👋

    I'm a bot and I'm here to welcome you to the KCD Community on Discord! Before you can join in the fun, I need to ask you a few questions. If you have any trouble, please email team@kentcdodds.com with your discord username (\`fredjoe#1234\`), an explanation of the trouble, and a screenshot of the conversation. And we'll get things fixed up for you.

    (Note, if you make a mistake, you can edit your responses).

    In less than 5 minutes, you'll have full access to this server. So, let's get started! Here's the first question:
    BOT: What's your first name?
    Fred Joe: Fred
    BOT: Great, hi Fred 👋
    BOT: _I've changed your nickname on this server to Fred. If you'd like to change it back then type: \`/nick fred\`_
    BOT: What's your email address? (This will look you up on Kent's mailing list. If you're not already on it, you'll be added and will receive a confirmation email.)
    Fred Joe: fred+already-subscribed@example.com
    BOT: Oh, nice, fred+already-subscribed@example.com is already a part of Kent's mailing list (you rock 🤘), so you won't be getting a confirmation email after all.
    BOT: Our community is commited to certain standards of behavior and we enforce that behavior to ensure it's a nice place to spend time.

    Please read about our code of conduct here: https://kentcdodds.com/conduct

    Do you agree to abide by and uphold the code of conduct? **The only correct answer is \\"yes\\"**
    Fred Joe: yes
    BOT: Great, thanks for helping us keep this an awesome place to be.
    BOT: **Based on what you read in the Code of Conduct**, what's the email address you send Code of Conduct concerns and violations to? (If you're not sure, open the code of conduct to find out).
    Fred Joe: team@kentcdodds.com
    BOT: That's right!
    BOT: Here are your answers:
      First Name: Fred
      Email: fred+already-subscribed@example.com
      Accepted Code of Conduct: Yes

    If you'd like to change any, then edit your responses above.

    **If everything's correct, simply reply \\"yes\\"**.
    Fred Joe: yes
    BOT: Awesome, welcome to the KCD Community on Discord!
    BOT: 🎉 You should be good to go now. 

    🎊 You now have access to the whole server. Welcome!
