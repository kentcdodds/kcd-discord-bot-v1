Schedule a recurring meetup:

Update a scheduled meetup:

Update a recurring meetup:

Start a new meetup right now:
  \`${commandPrefix}meetup start Remix and Progressive Enhancement\`

Add yourself to ${getFollowMeChannel(message.guild)}:

NOTE: For both the schedule and start commands, if you include a Zoom, Twitch, YouTube, or WebinarGeek link, that will be shared instead of creating a voice channel.
NOTE: If you just want to test things out and not notify people, include the text "TESTING" in your subject.
