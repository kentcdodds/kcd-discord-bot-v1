    BOT: Hello <@mock-user> üëã

    I'm a bot and I'm here to welcome you to the KCD Community on Discord! Before you can join in the fun, I need to ask you a few questions. If you have any trouble, please email team@kentcdodds.com with your discord username (\`fredjoe#1234\`), an explanation of the trouble, and a screenshot of the conversation. And we'll get things fixed up for you.

    (Note, if you make a mistake, you can edit your responses).

    In less than 5 minutes, you'll have full access to this server. So, let's get started! Here's the first question:
    BOT: What's your first name?
    fredjoe: Fred
    BOT: Great, hi Fred üëã
    BOT: _I've changed your nickname on this server to Fred. You can change it back if you'd like. (Learn more: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames>)_
    BOT: What's your email address? (This will look you up on Kent's mailing list. If you're not already on it, you'll be added and will receive a confirmation email.)
    fredjoe: fred@example.com
    BOT: Awesome, when we're done here, you'll receive a confirmation email to: fred@example.com.
    BOT: Our community is commited to certain standards of behavior and we enforce that behavior to ensure it's a nice place to spend time.

    fredjoe: yes
    BOT: Great, thanks for helping us keep this an awesome place to be.
    BOT: **Based on what you read in the Code of Conduct**, what's the email address you send Code of Conduct concerns and violations to? (If you're not sure, open the code of conduct to find out).
    fredjoe: team+coc@kentcdodds.com
    BOT: That's right!
    BOT: It's more fun here when folks have an avatar. You can go ahead and set yours now üòÑ
