    BOT: Hello <@mock-user> 👋

    I'm a bot and I'm here to welcome you to the KCD Community on Discord! Before you can join in the fun, I need to ask you a few questions. If you have any trouble, please email team@kentcdodds.com with your discord username (\`fredjoe#1234\`), an explanation of the trouble, and a screenshot of the conversation. And we'll get things fixed up for you.

    (Note, if you make a mistake, you can edit your responses).

    In less than 5 minutes, you'll have full access to this server. So, let's get started! Here's the first question:
    BOT: What's your first name?

    BOT: What's your email address? (This will look you up on Kent's mailing list. If you're not already on it, you'll be added and will receive a confirmation email.)
    fredjoe: fred@example.com

    fredjoe: team@kentcdodds.com
    BOT: That's right!
    BOT: It's more fun here when folks have an avatar. You can go ahead and set yours now 😄
